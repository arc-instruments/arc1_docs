# Introduction {.firstH1}

ArC Instruments® delivers high performance testing platforms for characterizing
‘en masse’ novel technologies in a fast and automated fashion.

ArC ONE® is specifically designed for working with emerging 2-terminal
nanoelectronic memory devices. The instrument is controlled through a simple
yet powerful user interface that allows for ArC ONE® capabilities to be broadly
accessible, from research students to competent test engineers.

ArC ONE® can effortlessly be integrated into any R&D setting to accelerate
discovery. It can be used with any prober for accessing from single up to 1024
devices directly on wafer or even be used as a stand-alone portable testing
capability to enable advanced in-situ physicochemical characterisation
techniques.

And while this instrument provides unrivalled versatility in testing, it does
so without compromising on performance; delivering nanosecond pulsing and other
bespoke state-of-art capabilities that are essential for characterising
advanced memory devices.

This guide covers the installation of this apparatus and details its
capabilities.

# Getting started

## Out of the box

The ArC ONE® system consists of a hardware instrumentation board (ArC ONE®) and
a dedicated software graphical user interface – GUI (ArC ONE Control®) The
hardware and adjacent components straight out of the box are illustrated below

![Out of the box: ArC ONE® hardware instrumentation board. Mini USB cable. AC adaptor](img/oob.jpg)

To power up the board, either plug in the provided AC power adaptor in the DC
plug, or connect a desktop power supply to the banana sockets. Toggle the power
supply switch towards the required power supply input. The red and green LEDs
should turn on, indicating the board is powered. For best results, utilise a
battery supply.

The PLCC socket holds packaged samples. Its pin map is illustrated below in
Figure 2.

In the case where devices need to be accessed away from the board, (eg via a
probe card to solid-state devices on wafer), the surrounding headers provide
access to individual word- and bitline addresses.

## Software Installation and Update

To install the ArC ONE® Control GUI, follow the steps below: (for Windows 7 and 8)

1. Download the source files from:
**http://files.arc-instruments.co.uk/release/ArC_ONE_Control_full.zip**
2. Unzip the files to a folder of your choice.
3. Download mBED drivers from
**http://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration** and follow
steps 1 and 2 to install the drivers
4. You’re good to go. Double click on ArC ONE Control.exe in the ArC ONE
Control folder to start the interface. Connect your PC to the board via the USB
cable and plug in the provided DC adaptor. If you notice any anomalies, reset
the mBED.

To update the ArC ONE® Control GUI suite, first start the interface, make sure
the ArC ONE® board is connected via USB and look for the Platform Manager
launch button on the top left corner of the GUI. An internet connection is
required for this feature.

If the button is active, then an update is available. Click the button to start
the automatic updater.  You can manually check for updates at *Settings » Check
for updates*.

# Using the ArC ONE® Control GUI

The ArC ONE® Control GUI is distributed under the General Public License (GNU)
Version 3. It is therefore an open-source copy, allowing any user to modify and
re-utilise its contents, as long as the original creator is mentioned. Keep a
copy of the initial source file to ensure the operation of the ArC® platform.

## At a Glance

The ArC GUI allows easy control of the ArC ONE® platform. It is divided into a
number of functional panels:

![At a glance — functional panels of the ArC ONE® GUI](img/at-a-glance.png)

**Toolbar**: contains buttons for saving data, creating, opening and clearing a
session, ArC ONE® connection management as well as a GUI session mode indicator
(refer to Section 3.3) and an ArC ONE® connection indicator, on the right hand
side. File menu contains Save, Open, Clear and Exit options. Settings menu
allows the user to modify hardware settings and choose a new working directory
on the fly. Help menu shows the documentation (this file), and ArC Instruments
Ltd. contact information.

**Manual Operations panel**: Contains buttons for reading a single selected cell or
the full array. The Custom Array checkbox restricts the crossbar active devices
to any combination of devices in a 32x32 array, based on a text file. The read
type can be changed via the drop down menu. The reading voltage can also be set
via the input text field. Clicking 'Update' updates the reading method on the
ArC ONE® board. Manual pulsing of 0 to ±12V and down to 90ns can be applied on
the selected device by pressing +Pulse (positive pulse) or -Pulse (negative
pulse). Separate input fields allow for independent setting of positive and
negative pulsing polarities.

**Crossbar Panel**: Direct selection of individual devices is performed by left
clicking the required position. The selected crosspoint is highlighted by a
thick black outline and represents the current device under test (DUT) for any
further operation. The resistive state of each device is represented by the
colour of the cell, and the colour coding is illustrated at the right of the
crossbar. Hovering over a cross-point reveals the absolute resistance value of
the last read operation. Additionally, left clicking and dragging allows
selection of a square region of devices in a crossbar if local testing is
required.

**Data Plot panel**: Top plot shows the resistive state evolution of a device.
Bottom plot shows the pulse amplitude and pulse duration per pulse number in
chronological order. During the application of an automated pulsing script, the
plot is updated live with incoming measurement data.

**Device History panel**: Contains the pulsing history for each device in the
crossbar, if any is available. History entries can be accessed to display
additional measurement results.

**Pulsing Modules panel**: The drop-down menu contains a number of custom pulsing
scripts, and selecting one displays its corresponding options which the user
can then set. Panels include custom device operation scripts such as
FormFinder, SwitchSeeker, standard IV measurement protocols such as
CurveTracer, and memristor specific characterisation pulsing scripts such as
Endurance and Retention. The pulsing scripts are described in detail in Section
3.5.

## Starting a new Session

On starting the GUI, the window on the right below will appear which allows
setting up a new measurement session. There are 2 main setting categories:

**General settings**

The *Session Mode* dropdown selects the operating mode of the system and four
options:

<figure class="floatright">
![New session panel](img/new-session.png)
<figcaption>New sesion panel</figcaption>
</figure>

1. **Live: Local** – normal operation mode, all outputs are applied to the
on-board package holder, and to the surrounding headers.
2. **Live: External BNC** – in this mode of operation your device under test
should be connected to the instrument through the BNC terminals. The board
applies stimuli and reads out data exclusively through the BNC terminals
(Figure 6). In the Crossbar Panel the target device appears as address `[W=1,
B=1]`. WARNING: Please ensure no package is connected in the PLCC68 holder or
through the header bank.
3. **Live: BNC to Local** – in this operating regime the instrument’s biasing
circuitry is disabled and all voltage/current biasing to target devices is
provided through the BNC terminals (Figure 7). The ArC platform only performs
routing, i.e. directs bias voltages/currents from the BNCs to the selected
device (in PLCC68 package or via header banks).
4. **Offline** – mode used to visualize previously acquired measurements
through the ArC system. ArC ONE® biasing hardware disabled.

**Working Directory** entry allows the user to choose the directory in which
measurement sessions will be saved. Press the browse button on the right of the
entry to navigate. This can be setup later as well.

**Session Name** entry sets the name of the session.

<div class="flex-container">

    <figcaption>BNC-to-Local mode</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

**Hardware settings**

**Reading Cycles**: Every test device resistive state READ measurement is by
default an average of `n` recorded data points. This entry sets the value of
`n`. A higher number translates into a slower, but more accurate measurement.
`n=50` is a reasonable, general purpose choice.

**Sneak Path Limiting** sets up the sneak path mitigation technique employed in
selectorless crossbar arrays. The user can chose between V/2, V/3. The
following table illustrates how the bias voltage, V~w~, is applied across
different devices in the two sneak path mitigation scenarios.

---------------------------------------------------
        Node           V/2 option      V/3 option
-------------------- -------------- ---------------
  Active wordline         V~w~           V~w~

   Active bitline         GND            GND

  Inactive wordline      V~w~/2         V~w~/3

  Inactive bitline       V~w~/2         V~w~/3
---------------------------------------------------

**Array Shape** counters set up the size of the array. Any size is selectable
between 1 and 32 word- and bitlines.

## Connecting to ArC ONE®

After the new session has been set up, the right hand side of the toolbar
should indicate the session mode, and the connection status showing
**Disconnected** as below.

![](img/disconnected.png){.centered}

Make sure ArC ONE® is connected to the PC via a USB cable, and the board is
powered up. A blue LED on the on-board mBED indicates the board is connected to
the PC, and red and green LEDs indicate the board is powered up.

![](img/main-toolbar.png){.centered}

From the toolbar (above), select the corresponding COM port of the ArC ONE®
board. If you don’t know it, you can find it in Windows by going to:

* Right click *My Computer*;
* Select *Manage*;
* On the left hand side, select *Device Manager*;
* Search for *Ports* (`COM` and `LTP`)  and expand;
* Look for a device named: *mbed Serial Port* (`COMX`), and make a note of the COM
    port number.

Return to the GUI and select the respective COM port from the dropdown list,
and click **Connect**.  If the port is not there, click Refresh and wait for up
to 10 seconds. The port should now appear.

Once the connection is successful, the connection status will turn green like
below:

![](img/connected.png){.centered}

If any connection problems occur, please refer to Section 5 of this manual.

## Basic Operations

Many basic operations such as reading and writing, as well as data display and
device history visualisation are available at a click of a button. As a general
rule of thumb, the buttons coloured in [orange]{.torange} perform invasive
operations on the selected device, or range of devices. Buttons coloured in
[dark blue]{.tdblue} perform non-invasive operations, such as updating ArC ONE®
settings or managing data display options.

### Device selection

Left click the required device on the **Crossbar Panel** to select it. The
device will be highlighted by a black outline. Any following invasive operation
will be performed on that device.

Hovering the mouse over a crossbar device shows address and resistance
information in the small floating information panel.

The address of the currently selected device appears on top of the **Manual
Operations** panel, along with its corresponding last measured value of
resistance.

Left click and drag in order to select a range of devices. A box with a thick
red outline will indicate the selected sub-array. Right click anywhere on the
**Crossbar Panel** to toggle the visibility of the box.

    <img alt="Crossbar Panel with range selection" src="img/crossbar-panel.png"/>
    <figcaption>Crossbar Panel with range selection</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

### Custom arrays

<figure class="floatright">
![Custom array controls](img/custom-array.png)
<figcaption>Manual Operations — Custom array controls</figcaption>
</figure>

If only a particular set of crosspoints is required for a measurement session,
these can be selected on the interface via checking the **Custom Array**
checkbox.  A file open dialogue will appear which allows the user to select a
text file containing the required addresses. *The file should contain the word-
and bitlines of the devices separated by a single comma character "`,`" one
pair per line.*

The same open file dialogue will appear if the browse array file button is
pressed.  The set of device addresses are then highlighted in the Crossbar
Panel, while the others are hidden. Any device select, or device operation will
be constrained to this set.  The devices within the range selected by left
clicking and dragging will constitute the target area for any operations
carried out via the [Apply to Range]{.torange} directive.


### Read operaion

In the **Read Operations** sub-panel, click [Read Single]{.torange} to perform
one READ operation on the selected device (highlighted in the **Crossbar
Panel**, and listed on top of the **Manual Operations** panel). The new value
of resistance is updated there.  The **Data Plot** panel will be updated with
the new measurement. Click [Read All]{.torange} to read all devices in the
crossbar.

<figure class="floatright">
![Custom array controls](img/manual-op-panel-2.png)
<figcaption>Manual Operations panel</figcaption>
</figure>

**Update Read** updates the reading method on the ArC board. Select the reading
method between the following read-out modes:

1. **Classic**: reads *only* at 0.5 V, suitable for linear resistors, fast;
2. **TIA**: reads at a programmable voltage;
3. **TIA4P**: RECOMMENDED - Kelvin sensing at a programmable voltage;

Select the reading voltage by left-clicking the up and down arrows in the
reading voltage counter, or introducing a float number by hand.  Remember to
click **Update Read** every time the reading method, or reading voltage is
changed.

![Classic read schematic](img/read-classic.svg)

![TIA-based read schematic](img/read-tia.svg)

### Manual Write Programming

In the Manual Pulsing sub-panel, single WRITE pulses can be applied on a
selected device.

Click the [+Pulse]{.torange} to immediately apply a positive voltage pulse, and
[–Pulse]{.torange} to apply a negative pulse.  The parameters of the pulse,
such as amplitude and duration, can be changed via the entry fields above the
corresponding buttons.

A READ operation is automatically performed after each manual pulse. The new
measurement is added in the **Data Plot** panel, along with the applied manual
pulse.

Checking the Lock checkbox disables the negative pulse parameter entry fields.
Clicking [–Pulse]{.torange} will then apply a negative pulse with the
parameters of the positive pulse entry fields.  For example: positive pulse
parameters are 1 V at 100 ms, negative pulse parameters are 2 V at 1 ms.
Clicking [+Pulse]{.torange} will apply 1 V at 100 ms, [-Pulse]{.torange} will
apply 2 V at 1 ms.  After checking the Lock checkbox, clicking
[+Pulse]{.torange} will apply 1 V at 100 ms, and [–Pulse]{.torange} will apply
-1 V at 100 ms.

### Data display

In the Display Options sub-panel, the user can modify the plot options in the
Data Plot panel.

Press **Full** to display all recorded data points for the selected device.
Press **Range** to display the last X number of points, where X is set in the
adjacent counter. Tick the log Y checkbox to set logarithmic Y axis in the top
subplot of the Data Plot panel.

The data plot panel is separated into two subplots as shown in the following
figure.

![The Data Plot panel in operation](img/data-plot-example.png)

Top subplot shows read value of resistance at each pulse number.
Bottom subplot shows:

* Blue horizontal line marker shows the voltage at which the respective
  resistance data point was measured at.
* Blue square marker shows a WRITE voltage pulse amplitude
* Green ‘+’ marker shows the pulse width of a WRITE voltage pulse, shown on the
  right hand side Y axis.

For example, in figure 14 at pulse #1, the resistance is read at 0.5 V as
~9 kΩ.  Next, a 2 V, 100 µs voltage pulse is applied shown at pulse #2. The
resistance is then automatically read as 15 kΩ, also at 0.5 V, indicated by the
blue horizontal line marker at the same pulse #2. Therefore, a 2 V, 100 µs
voltage pulse has changed the resistance of the device as read at 0.5 V, from
9 kΩ to 15 kΩ.

Right click on the Data Plot panel for extra display options such as setting
custom x and y-axis range, or exporting the figure image files.

### Device History

All invasive device operations are logged in the **Device History** panel on
left hand side of the interface.  Device addresses are added from top to bottom
in a chronological order following any operation.  The last device address
where an operation was performed is underlined.  Selecting a device address
from the **Device History** panel will also select and display its pulsing
history in the **Data Plot** panel.

Single device operations are listed below its corresponding address from top to
bottom in a chronological order.  These become visible by clicking the dropdown
marker.

READ operations are tagged with `Read x N`, where `N` is the number of read
pulses applied in sequence.  WRITE operations are tagged with `Pulse x N`,
where `N` is the number of manual WRITE pulses applied in sequence.

Advanced pulsing algorithms are tagged with their corresponding name.  Double
clicking some advanced pulsing algorithm entries displays further measurement
results.  For example, following a CurveTracer measurement, double clicking the
"CurveTracer" history entry will display the resulting IV curve. See
Section 3.5 for more information.

### Saving data

All raw data is saved in standard `.csv` files by clicking the save button in
the toolbar. Every READ or WRITE operation is represented as a line entry in
this file, following the format below

<div class="centrebox">
`Wordline, Bitline, Resistance, Amplitude, Pulse Width, Tag, ReadTag, Read Voltage`
</div>

* **`Wordline`** and **`Bitline`**: target device address.
* **`Resistance`**: last read resistance of target device.
* **`Amplitude`**: pulse amplitude of operation.
* **`Tag`**: type of operation and additional information.
* **`ReadTag`**: represents the read type employed for the READ operation. Its
  format is `RX` where `X` is a unique code for the read type.
* **`ReadVoltage`**: read voltage used for the READ operation (if any).

The `Tag` field is of special importance as it identifies the type of operation.
Manual read and pulse operations use the following conventions

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tag                  Description                 Comments
-------------------- --------------------------- ----------------------------
`F RX V=V`~`r`~      A [Read All]{.torange}      Data points are not visible
                     operation. `X` represents   in the Device History panel.
                     the read type `0`: Classic; V~r~ is saved in the
                     `1`: TIA; `2`: TIA4P. V~r~  `Amplitude` column and
                     is the read-out voltage.    `PulseWidth` is always `0`.

`S RX V=V`~`r`~      A [Read Single]{.torange}   Data point is visible in the
                     operation. `X` and V~r~ as  Device History panel.
                     above.                      `PulseWidth` is always `0`.

`P`                  Singular pulses when using  `Resistance` is the
                     the [±Pulse]{.torange}      resistance of the device
                     buttons in the **Manual     upon a read-out *immediately
                     Operations** panel.         after* the pulse.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All other pulsing modules use the `TAG_x` format. `TAG` is a unique identifier
assigned to each module. For instance CurveTracer uses the `CT` tag, Retention
uses the `RET` tag and so on. The `x` part is a single character either `s`,
`i` or `e`; `s` signals the *start* of the operation and `e` the *end*. All
*intermediate* points are assigned the `i` character. Additional information
for each module is provided in their respective sections. Depending on the
module, additional information may be provided in the `Tag`.

The following plot illustrates a set of operation performed on the device
with word- and bitline coordinates 15 and 15 respectively. The resulting
dataset is also presented below.

## Advanced pulsing modules

In addition to the manual operations there are several advanced pulsing scripts
available from the **Pulsing Modules** panel.

* **FormFinder** is a generic pulsed voltage ramp that can be also used for
  electroforming devices. Can be optionally applied up to a specific resistive
  threshold.
* **CurveTracer** performs standard pulsed or staircase I-V measurements.
* **Endurance** cycles a device between two states for any number of cycles
  and SET/RESET pulses.
* **Retention** measures the resistance of a device periodically.
* **SwitchSeeker** applies programming pulses of increasing width and amplitude
  to extract the operating range and optimal pulsing parameters of a device.
* **ConvergeToState** uses voltage ramps to gradually set a device to the
  desired resistive level.
* **MultiStateSeeker** probes a device for multiple stable resistive states.
* **ChronoAmperometry** measures the current and resistance of the device
  while it is being kept under bias.
* **MultiBias** applies a voltage pulse to multiple wordlines.
* **VolatilityRead** applies a single pulse and reads the transient response
  of a device.

Pulsing modules can be enabled by selecting a module from the *Panels* field
and clicking the **Add** button. Modules are independent so multiple copies can
be enabled at the same time with different biasing parameters. Similarly the
active panel can be removed by clicking the **Remove** button. The active
module can be applied to selected device, range of devices all the whole
crossbar by using the buttons [Apply to One]{.torange}, [Apply to
Range]{.torange} or [Apply to All]{.torange} respectively. Please note that
applying a module to multiple devices might not be available or not behaving
as expected depending on the functionality of the module. Refer to the
documentation of each module for more details.

### FormFinder

**FormFinder** is a versatile pulsing algorithm which applies a pulsed voltage
ramp with an option of two stop conditions. After each WRITE pulse, a READ
pulse is applied by default. A summary of the operation of this module can be
seen in the figure below.

![Illustration of the FormFinder algorithm](img/formfinder-algo.svg)

The following parameters are used for this module. A standard pulsed voltage
ramp, with one pulse per step can be achieved by setting [Nr of
pulses]{.tdblue} to 1, and making [Pulse width min (μs)]{.tdblue} and [Pulse
width max (μs)]{.tdblue} equal to the desired pulse width value.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pulse width step           Pulse width increment for each subsequent step. This can
                           be either in % of the previous step or a fixed step in μs
                           (see [Pulse progression]{.tdblue} below).

Pulse width max (μs)       Maximum pulse width.

Interpulse time (ms)       Delay between two subsequent WRITE pulses.

Nr of pulses               Number of WRITE pulses per step.

Resistance threshold (Ω)   Halts the ramp when resistance drops below this value.
                           Use 0 to disable.

Resistance threshold (%)   Same as above but as percentage of initial resistance.
                           Only used when [Rthr]{.tdblue} is checked.

pSR                        Series resistance: `1`: 1 kΩ; `2`: 10 kΩ; `3`: 100 kΩ;
                           `4`: 1 MΩ; `7`: disabled.

Negative amplitude         Check this to invert the polarity of the above voltages.

Use Rthr (%)               Enable the use of percentage-based thresholds

Pulse progression          Use multiplicative (%-based) or linear (fixed step)
                           increments for pulse widths.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tag**: `FF`. FormFinder follows the standard `FF_{s,i,e}` format.

### CurveTracer

**CurveTracer** is a standard triangular pulsed IV measurement module, with
incorporated current cut-off. During each WRITE pulse, a current measurement is
taken towards the end of the pulse.

![Illustration of the CurveTracer algorithm](img/ct-algo.svg)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter                  Description
----------------------     ----------------------------------------------------------

Negative V~max~ (V)        Maximum negative voltage.

Voltage step (V)           Voltage step for both polarities.

Start voltage (V)          Initial voltage for both polarities (min: 50 mV).

Step width (ms)            Hold time (or pulse width) of each voltage step
                           (min: 1 ms).

                           Set 0 to disable compliance.

Negative cutoff (μA)       Negative compliance current (min: 10 μA max: 1000 μA).
                           Set 0 to disable compliance.

Halt and Return            When checked the applied bias will be cut-off within
                           30 μs and return to 0 if current threshold has been
                           exceeded (if >0 μA).

Bias type                  Staircase mode set interpulse to 0 ms. In pulsed mode
                           device bias is set to 0 V for the duration of
                           interpulse time.

IV span                    Different sweep modes. *Only V±* restricts the I-V
                           sweep to that particular polarity. *Start towards
                           V±* selects the initial polarity when sweeping both
                           positive and negative voltages.

Following application of the protocol a "CurveTracer" entry will appear in the
**Device History** panel. Double click it to visualize the I-V measurement as
shown in fig. 18. Right click on the plots and select *Export* to save the
figure, or corresponding data.

Pressing the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">LIVE</span> button
opens up a panel similar to CurveTracer (fig. 19) offering live display of I-V
curves.

[GO LIVE!]{.torange} – Starts live measurement.

[Apply to One]{.torange} – Applies a normal CurveTracer measurement with
programmable nr of cycles via the corresponding entry field.

[BufferSize]{.tdblue} – sets the number of I-V cycles the panel records in its
buffer.

[Save Data]{.tdblue} – saves all the I-V curves recorded in the internal buffer.

The panel has a persistence of 5 I-V curves which are colour-coded based on
recording time: older I-V curves are coloured in increasingly lighter red.

During a live measurement, all parameters can be changed on-the-fly by entering
the corresponding values by hand or scrolling with your mouse while hovering on
the entry field.

The I-V figure can be scaled with your mouse by scrolling on its axes, and set
to auto-scale automatically by pressing the “A” symbol in the bottom left corner
of the figure (this symbol appears when hovering over the unscaled figure).

**Tag**: `CT`. The format of the tag is `CT_{s,i,e}_X`; `X` is the cycle
count.

### SwitchSeeker

**SwitchSeeker** is a state-of-art analogue resistive switching parameter
finder.  It automatically extracts the pulse parameters which elicit repeatable
analogue resistive switching. It achieves this by applying increasingly
invasive alternative polarity pulsed voltage ramps, until the resistance of the
device exits a programmable tolerance band. The algorithm consists of two
stages: In *stage I* the system attempts to detect the voltage polarity to
which the device is most sensitive by applying a series of alternating polarity
pulses with progressively higher voltage. This is followed by *stage II* it
applies a series of pulsed voltage ramps in alternating polarities in order to
switch the device. Stage II requires that the device exhibits some sort of
switching behaviour so it relies on stage I for feedback, however if the
dependence of the device on applied bias polarity is known it can also be run
independently. An illustration of the biasing routine used by SwitchSeeker can
be seen below.

![Illustration of the SwitchSeeker algorithm](img/ss-algo.svg)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter                  Description
-----------------------    ----------------------------------------------------------
Reads in trailer card      The number of read-out pulses before each programming train.

Programming pulses         The number of identical programming pulses.

Pulse duration (ms)        Pulse width of programming pulses.

Voltage min (V)            The initial voltage of each programming voltage ramp.

Voltage step (V)           ΔV between consecutive programming voltages.

Voltage max (V)            Maximum programming voltage. SwitchSeeker will terminate
                           once this has been reached.

Max switching cycles       Number of consecutive times the device is switched after
                           switching parameters have been determined.

Tolerance band (%)         Tolerance of each resistance measurements as percentage
                           of the initial.

Interpulse time (ms)       Δt between consecutive programming pulses.

Resistance threshold (Ω)   Maximum valid resistance. At very high resistances (> 10 MΩ)
                           measurement noise can be considerable which can lead to
                           unpredictable results.

Skip Stage I               If switching parameters are known, or of no interest,
                           checking this option will make the routine proceed directly
                           to stage II.

Stage II polarity          If the above option is checked this option determines the
                           initial polarity of stage II (that would be otherwise be
                           determined by stage I).

Read after pulse           If checked the routine will also perform an additiona READ
                           operation after each programming pulse is applied.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<figure class="floatright">
![SwitchSeeker results](img/ss-results.svg)
<figcaption>SwitchSeeker Results</figcaption>
</figure>

A *SwitchSeeker* entry will appear in the **Device History** panel. Double
click it to visualise the analogue resistive switching results. This is a graph
depicting the relative resistance change (ΔR/R~0~) as a function of programming
voltage. For devices with analogue behaviour the curve will feature a gradual
change in ΔR/R~0~ whereas predominantly binary devices will exhibit a resistance
change above a specific voltage.

**Tag**: `SS`. SwitchSeeker follows the standard `SS_{s,i,e}` format.

### Retention

**Retention** is a standard reliability test. It measures the
retention/stability of the current resistive state over time. This can be
either be applied to one or many devices which are read in parallel. The
read-out voltage used is the one specified in the **Manual Operations** panel.
A visualisation of each run is available by double-clicking the *Retention*
entry in the **Device History** panel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------    ----------------------------------------------------------
Read every                 Interval between two consecutive read-outs.

Read for                   Total duration of the test.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tag**: `RET`. Retention uses the `RET_{s,i,e}_XXXXXX` format where `XXXXXX` is
the absolute system timestamp.

### Endurance.

**Endurance** is another standard reliability test.  It applies alternating
polarity voltage pulse trains to toggle the state of single, range or full
array of devices between some ON and OFF values. It is possible to set current
cut-off values, independent for both half cycles (SET or RESET) by changing the
corresponding parameters. A read pulse is applied after each programming pulse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter                       Description
----------------------------    -----------------------------------------------------
Positive pulse amplitude (V)    Amplitude of the positive polarity pulse.

Negative pulse amplitude (V)    Amplitude of the negative polarity pulse.

Positive pulse width (μs)       Pulse width of the positive polarity pulse.

Negative pulse width (μs)       Pulse width of the negative polarity pulse.

Negative current cut-off (μA)   Current compliance for negative pulses.

No. of positive pulses          The amount of positive pulses to be applied per cycle.

No. of negative pulses          The amount of negative pulses to be applied per cycle.

Cycles                          Number of repeated SET/RESET operations.

Interpulse time (ms)            Time interval between consecutive pulses.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tag**: `EN`. Endurance follows the standard `EN_{s,i,e}` format.

### Volatility Read

**Volatility Read** applies a single pulse and then measure the transient
response of the device. The module begins by applying a single square-wave
pulse with parameters specified by the *Pulse Amplitude* and *Pulse Width*
fields.  Subsequently, the instrument starts measuring the resistive state of
the device at its maximum sampling rate of 200 ksps. By default, 100 of these
*spot reads* are averaged to yield a single assessment of the resistive state
of the DUT, although the user may change that value. Once enough resistive
state assessments have been collected (the *Read Batch Size*) the system will
interrupt its read-out sequence and transmit data from the microcontroller to
the PC, following which the procedure will repeat for as many batches as are
required until a stopping condition is met.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter                       Description
----------------------------    -----------------------------------------------------
Pulse amplitude (V)             Amplitude of the programming pulse.

Pulse width (μs)                Pulse width of the above pulse.

Read Batch Size (B)             Number of resistive state assessments.

Average cycles per point        "Spot-reads" to be averaged.

Stop time (s)                   Maximum time the assessment should run.

Stop t-metric                   The target t-metric (for T-test option).

Stop Tol. (%/batch)             The minimum change in resistance (for LinearFit
                                option) to register a stable assessment.

Stop option                     Choose between *Fixed Time*, *Linear Fit* and
                                *T-test* (see below).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The module can be configured to use any of the following three stopping conditions.

**Fixed time**: The system will continue reading batches of data until the
*Stop time* parameter is reached however once a data batch has started it will
finish even if it ends after the prescribed stop time.

**LinearFit**: The system will fit the resistive state of each batch with an
affine relation. If the absolute slope measured in % change of resistive state
per batch drops below the value specified by the *Stop Tol.* field, the system
considers the device to be at rest and the test run ends.

**T-test**:  The first and last 25 data points in the batch are processed as
two populations of measurements on which the t-test is applied. The t-metric is
then computed

<img src="img/tmetric.svg" class="centered"/>

where t is the t-metric, `μ` are the means of the two populations, `σ` their
variances and `n` the number of samples in each population. The test ends when
a batch featuring a t-metric below the user-defined threshold.

<div class="infobox">
* Regardless of stop condition chosen the volatility module will always
obey the *Stop Time* condition as a safety precaution.
* When choosing a stopping condition from the drop-down menu the relevant stopping
condition text fields are highlighted in red.

**Tag**: `VOL`. VolatilityRead follows the standard `VOL_{s,i,e}` format.

### STDP

**STDP** performs *Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity* measurements by
iteratively applying a voltage series given by the difference of two pre- and
post- synaptic voltage spikes with configurable delay.

![STDP module interface](img/stdp.png)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter                       Description
----------------------------    -----------------------------------------------------
Load Pre/Post Spike             Load a voltage series text file which defines the
                                pre- and post-synaptic pulses. This is a comma
                                separated text file with `(voltage (V), time (s))`
                                pairs, one per line. The last point *MUST* be of
                                zero amplitude (0 V).

Identical Spikes                When checked the post-synaptic spike will be
                                identical to the pre-synaptic.

Scale voltage/time              Scale all pre- and post-synaptic spikes in
                                amplitude and duration.

Time step (ms)                  Sets a time step which is used when iterating through
                                STDP events.

Only single event               When checked, only the STDP waveform shown in the top
                                right figure is applied, one time, when clicking the
                                [Apply to One]{.torange} button.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example in the figure above, pre- and post- spikes are identical, and their
maximum duration is 1 ms. Time step is set to 0.1 ms (henceforth referred to as
`timeStep`). By clicking on [Apply to …]{.torange}, the experiment will proceed
as follows: First, the resulting waveform of Pre-Post with `dt = 0 s` will be
applied, followed by the resulting waveform for `dt = +timeStep`, then for `dt
= -timeStep`, then for `dt =+2 × timeStep`, then for `dt = -2 × timeStep` and
so on, until `dt` becomes greater than the duration of the longest spike (in
this case both pre- and post- are the same at 1 ms).

### MultiBias

**MultiBias** is used to apply a voltage pulse to multiple active wordlines, or
read current from multiple devices in parallel sharing the same bitline.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter                       Description
----------------------------    -----------------------------------------------------
Active Wordlines                Whitespace delimited *active* wordline addresses.

Active Bitline                  Active wordline address. Only *one* bitline allowed.

WRITE amplitude (V)             Amplitude of the WRITE pulse.

WRITE pulse width (V)           Pulse width of the WRITE pulse.

READ voltage (V)                Voltage used for the READ operation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are no [Apply to …]{.torange} operations in MultiBias as it inherently requires
more than one device to work. The user is instead presented with the [WRITE]{.torange}
and [READ]{.torange} buttons.

[WRITE]{.torange}: When pressed, the module will apply a voltage pulse (V) to
the selected active wordlines. The active bitline is grounded, and all other
inactive word- and bit-lines will receive V/2.

[READ]{.torange}: When pressed, the module will apply the read voltage to the
active wordlines, then read and display the current on the active bitline in
the Current on Active Bitline entrybox. During this operation, all inactive
word- and bit-lines are held at virtual-GND.

The WRITE operation consists of the the following stages:

1. READ of all devices on the active bitline at the reading voltage set in the
   [Manual Operations]{.tdblue} panel;
2. Application of the WRITE pulse (*V*~write~);
3. READ of all devices on the active bitline at the reading voltage set in the
   [Manual Operations]{.tdblue} panel; These pulses and subsequent reads are
   logged in the [Data Plot]{.tdblue} and [Device History]{.tdblue} panels for
   each device on the active bitline. Devices on the active wordline will have
   received the full amplitude of *V*~write~, whilst the ones on the inactive
   wordlines will have received *V*~write~/2.

### ConvergeToState

**ConvergeToState** allows the user the program a memristor to a user-defined
resistive state. It employs an algorithm simimal to FormFinder to deliver
programming pulse ramps so as to gradually shift the resistance of the device
to the desired level. In contrast to FormFinder this is not limited to a
specific low resistance. ConvergeToState will instead try to "guess" the
correct polarity of by observing the transient response of the resistance and
will switch polarities if current resistance diverges away from the target. In
order to avoid never-ending loops the number of possible reversals is limited
to five (5).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter                       Description
----------------------------    -----------------------------------------------------
Target R (Ω)                    Desired resistive level.

Rt tolerance (%)                Sets the target resistance tolerance. If current
                                resistance is within the specified percentage of the
                                target the algorithm terminates.

Initial polarity                Selects the initial voltage polarity. This can be a
                                useful hint to the algorithm to avoid unnecessary
                                polarity switches.

Ro tolerance (%)                Sets the initial resistance tolerance. Any ΔR below
                                the specified value (in % of the initial) is *not*
                                registered as deviation from the initial state.

PW min/step/max (ms/%/ms)       Programming pulse width characteristics.
                                Before switching voltage amplitudes the system will
                                increase the pulse width in % of the minimum until
                                the maximum value has been reached.

Voltage min/step/max (V)        Programming amplitude characteristics. The system
                                will scan from min to max. Once max has been reached
                                the algorithm will terminate.

Interpulse (ms)                 Interval between two consecutive pulses.

Pulses                          Number of pulses per programming step.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tag**: `CTS`. CovergeToState follows the standard `CTS_{s,i,e}` format.

### ChronoAmperometry

**ChronoAmperometry** measures the current and resistance of a device
continuously while it is being kept under bias.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameter                       Description
----------------------------    -----------------------------------------------------
Bias (V)                        Applied voltage bias.

Bias duration (ms)              Duration of the applied pulse.

Number of reads                 Times the device will be sampled while under bias
                                (min: 2).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tag**: `CRA`. ChronoAmperometry follows the standard `CRA_{s,i,e}` format.

### MultiStateSeeker

**MultiStateSeeker** is used to assess multiple stable resistive states on
devices that exhibit analogue behaviour. It combines the polarity inference
ability of the [SwitchSeeker]{.tdblue} for polarity inference with additional
code to switch the device to progressively lower or higher non-volatile states
by programming it with controlled voltage pulses.

[MultiStateSeeker]{.tdblue} consists of three phases that can be applied on an
unknown device so as to assess the number of available states within a
user-programmable tolerance threshold. *Phase I* essentially determines the
sensitivity of the device to the polarity of the applied bias, not unlike to
how [SwitchSeeker]{.tdblue} does. Then, on *Phase II*, the device is driven to
a low (or high resistive) state that is stable enough to be regarded as its
"initial" state. The baseline criterion is either a linear fit or a t-test.
This is, finally, followed by *Phase III* where the actual state assessment is
performed. Using the polarity extracted from phase I a programming pulse is
applied followed by two sets of READ pulse trains separated by a user-defined
short-term retention interval. If current state is clearly separated by the
previous by up to 9σ then the state is registered. Otherwise the number of
pulses and subsequently the amplitude is increased until it does. Once a
maximum voltage has been reached the measurement terminates.

The third phase of [MultiStateSeeker]{.tdblue} presents a clickable entry
(*MultiState Calculation*) in the **Device History** panel that displays a
summary of calculated states.

**Parameters of Phase I**

The user parameters in Phase I follow the same semantics as those in
[SwitchSeeker]{.tdblue}.

Pulse width (ms)                Pulse width of pulse.

                                inferred from Phase I or *Inverse polarity* for the
                                opposite value.

Stability test                  The type of test to be used to evaluate stability of
                                baseline; either *Linear* or *T-test*.

Max time (s)                    Timeout for above test.

Tolerance or t-metric (%/-)     Stability criterion for linear fit and t-test

                                *voltage sweep*, *pulse width sweep* or
                                *programming sweep*.

Reads                           Number of pulses in READ train. Two READ trains
                                separated by the retention interval (see below) will
                                be applied after each programming step.

Monotonicity                    How the algorithm should treat resistance reversals
                                (e.g. resistance decreases when the overall trend is
                                increasing). *Stop on reversal*: stops immediately;
                                *Move to next step*: apply the next pulse in
                                sequence; *Ignore*: do nothing.

**Tag**: `MSS1` to `MSS3` for each respective state. Each one follows the
standard `MSSX_{s,i,e}` format.

## SuperMode

**SuperMode** allows users to create chains of measurement modules to better
fit your characterisation procedures. Instead of applying consecutive different
pulsing modules by hand, simply create an experiment chain with full
flexibility.  The module can be found as a bold entry in the drop-down list on
the [Advanced Modules Panel]{.tdblue}.

![SuperMode panel overview](img/supermode.png)

The left-hand side column contains the available modules built in the platform,
along with basic ones such as time delay (Delay), single voltage pulse and
single READ operation. Furthermore, [Start Loop]{.tdblue} and [End
Loop]{.tdblue} indicators can be utilised as well.

You can drag-and- drop your required modules onto the next column on the right
(the chain column), between the blue **Start** and **End** markers. Rearrange
them also by drag-and-drop, and discard unwanted ones by dropping them outside
the chain column. When applying such an experiment chain to your devices, the
instructions will be executed from top to bottom ([Start]{.tdblue} to
[End]{.tdblue}).

Double click on a positioned module in the chain column to modify the procedure
parameters.  The selected module will be highlighted in the chain column.
Double click on the [Start Loop]{.tdblue} indicator to set the number of
repetitions of the block contained. Nested loops are possible, and the system
will check the order of the [Start Loop]{.tdblue} and [End Loop]{.tdblue}
indicators for consistency before starting an experiment.

You can [Save]{.tdblue} and later [Load]{.tdblue} measurement chains via the
corresponding buttons.  The [Clear]{.tdblue} button will delete all entries
from the chain column.

# Troubleshooting

## Connection issues

In the case when the ArC ONE® board does not connect to the ArC GUI, try the following:

1. Make sure the board is powered by checking the LED power indicators.
2. Make sure the board is connected to the PC. A blue LED next to the mBED USB
  connector should be ON. If the mBED is connected and no blue LEDS are on,
  contact us.
3. Unplug the USB cable and plug it back in.
4. Restart the GUI (make sure you save any live data).

In the case when the ArC GUI does not receive correct data from the ArC board,
save your data, reset the mBED and restart the GUI.
